	* fork.c (sys_fork): Fixed.  Hopefully this will fix a lot of
	related problems/bugs that I have been unable to understand/fix
	in the past.  The problem was really nasty, mostly because I
	wasn't careful enough when initializing the child stack.  Copying
	the internal stack of the parent was a *very* silly thing to do.
	Now things are under control :-)

	* main.c (sys_kctrl): Adapted to the new debug level setup scheme.

	* kpid.c (get_kpid): Modified to only allocate the last two empty
 	process slots if superuser.  This is a little bit flexible than
 	reserving only the last one - we can type something like:
	`ps | more'
	to see what is going on...

	* process.c (find_unused_pid): New function.  The pid is no longer
 	allocated by simply incrementing `latest_pid'.  The pid is now a
 	number between 0 and 32767 and the kernel checks to see if there
 	is no other process using that pid as a process, process group or
	session id.

	* system.c (sys_getprocinfo): Bug fix.  SYSTEM_OPEN_MAX replaced
	with SYSTEM_PROCESS_MAX.  Silly me...
