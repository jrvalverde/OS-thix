	* inode.c (__namei): Fixed a possible race due to releasing i_no
	too soon when finding directory entries.

Tue May 14 10:39:38 1996  Tudor Hulubei  <tudor@chang.pub.ro>

	* generic.c (sys_read, sys_write): Fixed a bug introduced in
	0.3.4.  The return value is correctly reported in all cases.

	* inode.c: inode changed to inode_t.  dinode changed to dinode_t.

	* buffer.c: buffer changed to buffer_t.

	* inode.c (i_remove): New function.

	* mount.c (fs_in_use): Inodes are deleted from the cache when
	fs_in_use() is called from sys_umount() so that when remounting a
	new file system on removable devices we won't get inodes
	belonging to the old file system from the inode cache (hash
	table).  An annoying, but harmless side effect is that if
	fs_in_use() returns 1 (there are still busy inodes on the file
	system other than the root inode), before returning it might have
	removed some inodes from the cache.  The alternative is to parse
	the inode cache twice, first to check for busy inodes and second
	to delete all the inodes pointing to disk inodes in the file
	system to be unmounted.  Slower.

	* Just decided to keep a ChangeLog :-)
