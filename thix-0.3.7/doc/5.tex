{\small \bf \center 5. Future Work\\
}

\vspace{2cm}
{\tiny Many free software package have been ported to {\em Thix}.  The
kernel appears to be quite stable, and able to run many programs
available on the Internet that do not involve networking.  However,
many things still need to be done:

\vspace{1cm}


\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - the file system should be enhanced and optimized;\\
\> currently the support for bad blocks handling is not used
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - mapping files into memory, file locks, IPC, etc. should\\
\> be implemented
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - many device drivers have to be written: printer and serial\\
\> drivers are important, also a mouse driver is necessary for\\
\> the X Window System to run
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - a complete X Window System port will require a select()\\
\> system call, an ioctl() for putting the keyboard in raw\\
\> mode and a full duplex communication channel
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - the scheduler should be enhanced to be able to\\
\> differentiate between classes of users
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - floating point support should be added for machines\\
\> with hardware floating point processors; for machines\\
\> without FPU, the GNU C compiler provides a software\\
\> emulation library
\end{tabbing}

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{1cm} - \= \kill
\hspace{1cm} - a port of GNU Emacs should be done as soon as possible,\\
\> with the idea of providing the user with a powerful\\
\> development environment
\end{tabbing}
