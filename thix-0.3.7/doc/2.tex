{\small \bf \center 1. Process Management\\
}

\vspace{2cm}

{\tiny Processes are implemented taking advantage of the Intel 80386
processor's features:

\hspace{1cm} - Task State Segments

\hspace{1cm} - Local Descriptor Tables

\hspace{1cm} - fast context switch instructions

The scheduler's frequency is 100 Hz.  The scheduler's internal data
is kept in separate structures, in order to avoid invalidating the
processor's page cache.

{\small \bf \center 2. Protection\\
}

\vspace{2cm}

{\bf Thix} provides a completely protected environment:

\hspace{1cm} - the kernel cannot be damaged by a user level process

\hspace{1cm} - processes are protected against each other

\hspace{1cm} - every attempt to call an invalid system call is detected

\hspace{1cm} - each system call checks the validity of its arguments

\hspace{1cm} - all the machine dependent exceptions are handled
