{\tiny The {\bf Thix} kernel is an almost complete implementation of the
POSIX.1 specifications.  It provides:


\hspace{1cm} - multitasking with preemptive scheduling

\hspace{1cm} - protection

\hspace{1cm} - virtual memory with up to 4 Gb of address space

\hspace{1cm} - demand paging

\hspace{1cm} - shared executables

\hspace{1cm} - swapping on multiple devices

\hspace{1cm} - POSIX.1 signals

\hspace{1cm} - device drivers

\hspace{1cm} - a native file system


On top of this kernel there are currently running about 125
Unix utilities, including the GNU C compiler and the related tools.
