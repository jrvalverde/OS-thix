		    Installing Thix on your Hard Disk
		    =================================


WARNING
*******

Installing Thix on  your hard  drive is  a complicated procedure  that
should  be  done  with great  care.  In   order to  avoid any possible
problems, please backup  everything before proceeding.  Note that Thix
is still  alpha, it probably has many  bugs, and there is no guarantee
that it will work.  You have been warned.


Prerequisites
-------------

- A Linux system with an `a.out' GNU C compiler >= 2.6.3.
- An (E)IDE hard disk.
- A 3.5" floppy drive installed as /dev/fd0
- The contents of the Thix archive at ftp://ftp.pub.ro/pub/thix:

	images/thix-demo.bin.gz
	images/thix-install.bin.gz
	distribution/disk[1-5]
	sources/thix/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz
	sources/tfs/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz

- Optionally you can download the sources of the Thix specific
  utilities and C library startup:

	sources/misc/bin.tar.gz
	sources/misc/crt0.tar.gz


Step 1 - Does Thix recognize your system?
-----------------------------------------

Uncompress the demo floppy disk image (thix-demo.bin.gz).  It contains
the image of a bootable 3.5" floppy disk.  Dump it  on a formated 3.5"
floppy disk.  Under Linux, if you  have appropriate permission (root),
you can type:

dd if=thix-demo.bin of=/dev/fd0

You now have a bootable  Thix floppy.  Reboot  your machine and try to
boot from it.

Read the Thix boot  messages  carefully and see  if  Thix is able   to
correctly detect  the geometry of your  hard disk and if  it correctly
reports your *primary* disk   partitions.  Note that  Thix is  not yet
able to detect  extended  partitions or secondary (E)IDE  controllers.
It should only  detect your master/slave  hard disks (if any) on  your
first controller.  If your hard disk works with LBA mode enabled, Thix
should report it.

Switch to  another  virtual  tty and  type  root  at the login  prompt
(password root).  After logging in, try to see  if things look ok.  An
important thing is  to  make sure that  the special  file denoting the
partition  on which you  want to install  Thix actually corresponds to
your partition.  Thix uses the same name scheme  for its special files
as Linux, so you will probably have no  problems figuring out which is
the special file needed.  As  an example, if  you want to install Thix
in the third partition on your primary master hard disk, you will want
to take a look at /dev/hda3.

The only thing you can do is to type:

more /dev/hda3

and see if `more' displays something that you know it should be there,
(a boot sector or something).  Note that the  kernel installed on this
floppy has the hard disk write routine disabled.  At the first attempt
to write something on the disk, Thix will halt.

When you're done, press Ctrl-Alt-Del to reboot.


Step 2 - Compiling the Thix sources
-----------------------------------

Assuming everything went ok since now, you should boot Linux again and
compile the  mktfs/tfsck utilities, the  Thix kernel and the partition
boot sector.  Here is how you should do it.

Unpack the sources of the Thix FS utilities (tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz) and the
kernel sources (thix-0.3.7.tar.gz). At this  point you should have two
directories  in the  current   directory: thix-0.3.7   and  tfs-0.2.1.
Create a symbolic link called `thix' to the thix-0.3.7 directory and a
symbolic link called `tfs' to  the tfs-0.2.1 directory.  You will need
them later.

Run  the Linux fdisk utility and  take a look   at the number  of 1 Kb
blocks in  the partition  where  you want  to install Thix.    To make
things clear, I will assume that you want to install Thix on /dev/hda3
and  that /dev/hda3   is 66528 1K  blocks  long  (this is my   current
configuration).

Enter    the  tfs directory.    Edit   the file    tfsck.c and  change
THIX_PARTITION_NAME to  denote    the name of the    target  partition
("/dev/hda3" in our case) and  THIX_PARTITION_SIZE to the number of 1K
blocks (66528).

Edit  the file  mktfs.c and  change  THIX_PARTITION_NAME to denote the
name of the target partition ("/dev/hda3" in our case).

(This things  have been hard coded  here in order  to  prevent me from
accidently running mktfs on the wrong partition :-)

Type  `make dep  all'.  This  should build  both `tfsck' and  `mktfs'.
Note that this will require the Thix source  tree to be in the ../thix
directory.

Now go into the Thix source tree (../thix).

If you  are running  an older (a.out)  version  of Linux, you need  to
remove the  `-b i486-linuxaout'  flag from CFLAGS   in the  top  level
Makefile.  This option is there in order to  make sure an a.out kernel
image is generated on ELF Linux systems (you need to install the a.out
GNU C compiler, of course).

If your machine is  a i386, then edit the  top level Makefile and  add
-D__i386k__ to  CFLAGS.  This is done in  order to work around an i386
design   flaw  that   prevents  the processor    from generating  page
protection faults when writing to   read only pages from kernel  mode.
i486 and  better  processors don't   have  this problem.  The  default
Makefile is for processors >= i486.

Edit the file fs/mount.c and set the root_device to point to the first
floppy disk.  That  is,  uncomment this lines (remove  the surrounding
#if 0 / #endif pair):

/* /dev/fd0  */
int root_device = FDC_MAJOR * 0x100 + 0;

This will tell the kernel to load the root file system from floppy.
(Note that you should also comment out the line referring to the hard
disk partition.)

For  a detailed description  of the device  major/minor numbers please
refer to the file doc/DEVICES included in the distribution.

Ok, now  you should edit the file   driver/block/hdc.c to put  a small
test there that will stop  the kernel  at  the first attempt to  write
data to your hard disk anywhere else but your Thix root file system or
swap partition.  Search  for the string  `INVALID'  in the hdc_write()
function and modify that test to only allow  write access to your hard
disk if the cylinder number is between the start  and end of your Thix
root file  system.  You can   find these values   by running the Linux
fdisk program, but be aware  that the values reported are artificially
incremented by one!

As an example,   here it is  the output  of  `fdisk' on  my computers'
/dev/hda:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Using /dev/hda as default device!

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hda: 64 heads, 63 sectors, 525 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 4032 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1           1       1     381  768064+   5  Extended
/dev/hda2         382     382     398   34272    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
/dev/hda3         399     399     431   66528    6  Unknown
/dev/hda4   *     432     432     525  189504    7  OS/2 HPFS
/dev/hda5           1       1     153  308385   83  Linux native
/dev/hda6         154     154     331  358816+  83  Linux native
/dev/hda7         332     332     381  100768+  83  Linux native
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, the Thix partition (/dev/hda3) is reported as starting
at cylinder 399 and ending  at cylinder 431, which  is not true.   The
Thix  partition's  first  and  last cylinders  are  398  and 430.  The
difference comes from   the fact that  fdisk  reports 1-based cylinder
numbers while the BIOS and the (E)IDE controllers expect 0-based ones.
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF.

Type `make dep  all' in the kernel  top level directory.   This should
build the  sources.   At the end  of the  compilation process a kernel
image called `thix' will be created.

The  last  step  in compiling  the  sources  is  the creation   of the
partition  boot sector.  Go into   the boot/harddisk directory in  the
Thix source  code  tree.  Edit  the  file boot.S.    Set the HEAD  and
SECTORS constants to the number of heads and the number of sectors per
track  of your hard disk.  Also  set the START_CYLINDER and START_HEAD
constants to the  number of the first cylinder  of your Thix partition
(0-based) and   to  the number   of the  head  (usually  0)  where the
partition starts.  USE LBA NUMBERS IF YOUR HARD DISK USES LBA!

Type `make'.  You should obtain a file called `boot.bin'.  This is the
partition boot sector.  We will dump it on the disk later.


Step 3 - Format the Thix Partition
----------------------------------

Before  formatting   the  Thix file  system,  make  sure  you  are not
currently using it under Linux.  If it  is mounted, unmount it.  Also,
if  that partition is listed  in  the /etc/fstab  file, remove it NOW.
Linux  will have problems rebooting  if   it finds a  partition in  an
unknown format in the /etc/fstab list.

Use the mktfs utility created at step 2 to format your Thix partition.
Type `mktfs  -h' to get the list  of possible options.   I suggest you
reserve about 256K for the kernel (the -k option).  Here  it is what I
used to create my Thix file system on /dev/hda3:

mktfs -k 256 /dev/hda3 66528

Now go and edit your /etc/lilo.conf file and add an entry for /dev/hda3.
Here it is the relevant part of my lilo.conf file:

other = /dev/hda3
  label = Thix
  table = /dev/hda

Restart lilo to make the changes permanent.


Step 4 - Creating the Install Floppy
------------------------------------

Uncompress the   install floppy disk image   (thix-install.bin.gz) and
dump it on a formatted  floppy disk, precisely the  same you did  with
the demo floppy.

This floppy is  a self contained  install disk.  However, in order  to
take advantage of the test you  put in the  hard disk driver, you will
have to dump the kernel image obtained at step 2 on it:

dd if=thix of=/dev/fd0 bs=1024 seek=2

Note that this is  not a necessary step, but  the floppy disk contains
no test against invalid cylinder access (other than the one imposed by
the hard disk geometry).


Step 5 - Preparing the Thix Hard Disk Partition
-----------------------------------------------

In order to be able  to boot from your  Thix hard disk partition, that
partition should contain a valid boot  sector and a kernel.  The first
part (the boot sector) is easy to  accomplish - you have assembled the
boot sector at step 2.  Just dump it on the partition:

dd if=boot.bin of=/dev/hda3

The second step is to recompile the kernel with a new root_device.

Go into the Thix source tree (../thix).

Edit  the  file fs/mount.c and  set the  root_device  to  point to the
partition you want to install Thix on. That is, uncomment this lines:

/* /dev/hda3  */
int root_device = HDC_MAJOR * 0x100 + 4;

Now adjust  the minor device number as  needed.  Here is the  table of
hard disk minor device numbers:

	  Device   |  Minor
	===========+========
	 /dev/hda1 |	2
	 /dev/hda2 |	3
	 /dev/hda3 |	4
	 /dev/hda4 |	5
	 /dev/hdb1 |	6
	 /dev/hdb2 |	7
	 /dev/hdb3 |	8
	 /dev/hdb4 |	9

As you can see from our example /dev/hda3's minor device number is 4.

This will tell the kernel to load the root file system from /dev/hda3.
(Note  that you  should  also comment  out  the line  referring to the
floppy disk.)

Rebuild the   kernel by typing `make'.   The  file fs/mount.c  will be
recompiled and a new kernel image will be generated.   Dump it on your
Thix root file system (/dev/hda3 in our example):

dd if=thix of=/dev/hda3 bs=1024 seek=2

Your Thix file system is now bootable.   Don't jump on it, though, you
will have to install some programs first :-)


Step 5 - Installing the System
------------------------------

At  this stage  we have a  bootable  (but empty)  Thix file  system on
/dev/hda3 and an install disk.  Exit Linux  and boot the install disk.
At the login prompt   type root (password   root) and then  start  the
`install' script.   Specify the name  of   the target partition  as  a
command line argument:

install /dev/hda3

This  will install a minimal set  of utilities on /dev/hda3 and create
the necessary  special files in  the /dev directory.  When done, press
Ctrl-Alt-Del to reboot.

At the LILO: prompt type `Thix'. This should boot Thix from /dev/hda3.


Step 6 - Installing Software Packages
-------------------------------------

Put  the contents of  disk1 to disk5 on  a separate 1.44 MSDOS floppy.
Boot Thix.  Log in as root (password root) and type

mdir a:

to see if you can  list the files on floppies.    You may install  any
package you want from any floppy, in any order, by running:

pkginst package-name

For example,  to install the  GNU C compiler,  insert the  floppy disk
containing gcc.tgz in the first drive and type:

pkginst gcc.tgz


Step 7 - Cleaning up
--------------------

Finally, the last  step.  Run `instclean' to  ranlib the C  libraries,
link gunzip to gzip, set some file permissions, etc.  Then reboot.

To make sure the Thix  file system contains no  errors, boot Linux and
run the tfsck utility like this:

tfsck -vir /dev/hda3

It should report any error found and prompt you before repairing.

You're done.
