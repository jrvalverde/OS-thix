	* vtty.c (update_leds): Now uses keyboard_ready() instead of the
	brain damaged kbd_wait.  Thanks to Liviu Dudau who figured out the
	problem.

	* vtty.c (vtty_keyboard_interrupt): The keyboard problem has been
 	fixed.  0xf0 was incorrectly setting igncnt to 1.  Now the first
 	key pressed is correctly detected.  Also, 0x00 & 0xff which signal
 	"keyboard buffer full" are now catched.
	(struct): kbd{head,tail,count} are now volatile.

	* lp.c (lp_write): Implemented.  Not tested, though...

	* vtty.c (vtty_open): Fixed to return -ENXIO if the minor number
	is invalid.

	* vtty.c (keys): All the escape sequences for ESC (\x1b) have been
	converted to \e.  This is a GNU C extension, but Thix cannot be
	compiled woth other compiler anyway.

	* vtty.c (keys): Alt-BACKSPACE & Alt-TAB changed to return ESC
	BACKSPACE & ESC TAB, as they are supposed to.
